# 榫境 / Sunjing Puzzles

[Play online / 在线试玩](https://sunjing-puzzles.vercel.app) · [Creation record / 制作记录](CREATION.md) · [Request history / 需求记录](PROMPTS.md)

A Chinese-language 3D wooden-puzzle workshop with a six-piece interlocking lock and two Huarong Dao sliding-block layouts. Rotate the wooden model, choose a piece, discover the removal order, or make space for Cao Cao to reach the exit.

项目发起人及提交者 / Project initiator and submitter: [MartinDelophy](https://github.com/MartinDelophy). Implemented through an iterative Codex-assisted workflow. **Exact GPT-6 Astra attribution is pending creator confirmation**, as documented in [CREATION.md](CREATION.md).

## Play / 玩法

- **六合 · 孔明锁:** six connected wooden pieces with no initial overlap; swept-path collision checks prevent pulling pieces through other wood. This is a teaching adaptation of interlocking joinery, not a verified historical replica or inventor attribution.
- **初见 · 华容道:** an introductory layout with a shortest solution of 10 single-cell moves.
- **横刀 · 华容道:** the classic 横刀立马 layout, with a shortest solution of 116 single-cell moves under this implementation's counting rule.

Desktop: drag the lock to rotate it, click a wooden piece or its numbered button, then use an extraction button or arrow key. For Huarong Dao, select a block and use arrow keys/buttons. Touch: drag to rotate the lock; swipe a Huarong Dao piece to move one cell. Zoom buttons, hints and move undo are provided. Z undoes a move; R restarts; Esc clears selection.

Free browser play; no account or API key. Requires a modern browser with WebGL 2. Touch controls and responsive styles are implemented; device-specific mobile testing is not claimed. The current puzzle is saved only in that browser's local storage. Switching levels starts a new game; reset, level changes and reload do not preserve the undo history. All game logic runs locally, including the worker that computes hints.

## Run locally / 本地运行

Node.js **22.13 or later** and npm are required. From this repository's root:

```sh
cd works/sunjing-puzzles
npm ci --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
npm run dev
```

Open the Local URL printed by the server. Keep the terminal running while playing. Dependency installation needs network access; there are no runtime CDN fonts, models, textures or API calls.

## Verify and build / 检查与构建

```sh
npm test
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The build uses `output: 'export'` and writes a static site to `dist/client/`. Serve that directory using a local HTTP server or deploy its contents to a static HTTPS host:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory dist/client
```

Open http://localhost:8080. Do not open the HTML through `file://`, because modules and the solver worker require an HTTP origin. This submission does not contain personal environment files or account-specific hosting metadata.

## Vercel deployment / Vercel 部署

The current public demo is [sunjing-puzzles.vercel.app](https://sunjing-puzzles.vercel.app). On 2026-09-08, the existing validated static export was uploaded manually to Vercel. Git-based automatic deployment is not configured.

For future builds from this repository, set Vercel's Root Directory to `works/sunjing-puzzles`, Framework Preset to **Other**, and Node.js to **22.x** (at least 22.13). The included `vercel.json` disables framework detection with `framework: null`, installs with `npm ci`, builds with `npm run build`, and publishes `dist/client`.

Publish the complete static output, including `/_next/static/`, `/solver-worker.js`, and the exported HTML and RSC payload. Game logic and hints run in the browser; no server database or API key is needed. Browser-local progress at the previous Netlify or Sites origin does not transfer automatically to the Vercel origin.

## Optional existing Netlify deployment / 可选的现有 Netlify 部署

The earlier deployment is [sunjing-puzzles.netlify.app](https://sunjing-puzzles.netlify.app). It is retained as an optional existing deployment; the collection's current playable link uses Vercel.

`netlify.toml` sets the build command to `npm run build`, the publish directory to `dist/client`, and Node.js to 22. When importing this collection repository into Netlify, set the base directory to `works/sunjing-puzzles`. That Netlify site was published manually from the validated build; Git-based automatic deployment is not configured.

To update the existing site from this game directory after building, with Netlify CLI installed and signed in to the owning account:

```sh
npm run build
netlify deploy --site sunjing-puzzles --dir dist/client --no-build --prod
```

Netlify account linkage stays in the ignored `.netlify/` directory. Because progress is stored per browser origin, an existing save at the former URL does not transfer automatically to the Netlify URL.

## Structure

- `app/page.tsx`: interface, state, controls, progress and success feedback.
- `components/PuzzleScene.tsx`: Three.js wood meshes, materials, picking, orbit and touch handling.
- `lib/game.ts`, `lib/lock.json`, `lib/boards.json`: rules and validated puzzle layouts.
- `public/solver-worker.js`: off-main-thread BFS hints.
- `tests/rules.test.mjs`: eight checks for connectedness, collisions, removal order, board movement and solver replay.

React, Vinext/Vite, Three.js, Tailwind CSS and selected shadcn/Base UI components. See [third-party and licensing notes](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
